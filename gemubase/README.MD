# Setup
The setup/base part of Gemu allows the user to set up all the packages required to run Gemu.

Please note that this folder is separate from Gemu and was created *outside* the Gemu folder.

When compiling Gemubase.java to a JAR, put it on the root of the Gemu folder and call the JAR *setup.jar*
